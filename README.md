# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This course introduces basic methods for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms emphasizing methods useful in practice. Different algorithms for a given computational task are presented and their relative merits evaluated based on performance measures. The following important computational problems will be discussed:

- Sorting and searching
- Elements of divide-and-conquer
- Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
- Advanced data structures
- Graph algorithms (shortest path, spanning trees, tree traversals)
- String matching
- NP completeness
